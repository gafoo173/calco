# calco - High-Performance Math Library for Python

**calco** is a high-performance, cross-platform math library written in C and exposed as a Python extension.

It provides fast, accurate, and comprehensive implementations of advanced mathematical operations beyond what's available in Python's `math` module.  
**calco** is designed to be the fastest library for complex or moderately complex individual mathematical operations in Python, offering speeds over **30% faster** than the built-in `math` module. Additionally, it includes ready-to-use functions not available in the standard library.
